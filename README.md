# Analysis of Political Partisanship and the Coronavirus in the United States

### 1. Essential Question

Hyper-partisanship has inevitably invaded public health in the United States. While Coronavirus cases continue to surge across the country with no end in sight, party loyalty has divided the nation into those who trust public health experts and those who follow the advice of party leaders.

With this in mind, I seek to answer: What affect, if any, does party identification have on Coronavirus cases throughout the United States? In general, it appears that Democrats are relatively more likely to follow public health guidelines while Republicans listen to elected officials who downplay the severity of the virus. Using data primarily from the New York Times and 2016 election data, I am interested in finding out whether there exists a true (versus perceived) impact on public health as it relates to COVID-19 from being either a Democrat or a Republican.
